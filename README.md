# Disable Search Slug

Stops `/search/...` URLs from working, resulting in a WordPress 404 page not found.

## Description 

If bots are attacking your site by appending `/search/a-random-string-or-word`, then those pages may be getting indexed by search engines, or populating search logs.

This plugin disables that permalink structure.

Search forms will still work, and the search results page will use the less index-friendly `?s=search-term` format.

## Installation

### Upload

1. Download the latest tagged archive (choose the "zip" option).
* Go to the __Plugins__ â†’ __Add New__ screen and click the __Upload__ tab.
* Upload the zipped archive directly.
* Go to the Plugins screen and click __Activate__.

### Manual

1. Download the latest tagged archive (choose the "zip" option).
* Unzip the archive.
* Copy the folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
